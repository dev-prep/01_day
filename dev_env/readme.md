#Dev Prep

###Navigating around your development environment

Welcome to the new and exciting world of being a programmer! In order to kick us off this morning we are going to be setting up a simple development environment (developer fancy talk for installing a few things) and getting familiar with **git** and **github**; The developer's most useful tool. 

#ROADMAP
* Install Fest
* Use the most common commands to navigate and modify files / directories via the Terminal.app (on Mac) or GitBash (on Windows)
* Summarize a basic filesystem structure, including absolute and relative paths
* Differentiate between navigating the file system using the CLI vs. the GUI
* Explain basic git commands like init, add, commit, push, pull and clone
* Distinguish between local and remote repositories
* Create, copy, and delete repositories locally, or on Github

##Install Fest

* Google Chrome 
* Sublime Text Editor
* Atom
* MacDown or other open source Markdown editor
* Github Desktop (and creating a new github account)
* Slack (Desktop or Web App log in) 
* [Dev Prep](https://github.com/dev-prep) on Github

##Intro to Command Line

####What is A Command Line Interface?

A command-line interface, sometimes referred to as a CLI, is a human/computer interface into which you can type text commands to perform specific tasks â€” in contrast to the mouse's pointing and clicking on menus and buttons (Graphic User Interface or GUI). 

> What are the pros and cons of using a CLI versus a GUI?

We use a program called a 'shell' that provides the command line interface. The shell interprets these commands and passes them to the master control program of the computer (known as the 'kernel'). There are many different varieties of shell that you can choose from, but the most common these days is the Bash shell.

We run the Bash shell inside our Terminal.app (On Mac)
A similar version to Bash shell called Git Bash is available on Windows and comes with Github Desktop for Windows... so go ahead! Load it up! 

###Basic terminal commands

```
pwd(present working directory)	
cd (change directory)
ls (list)	
touch (creates a file)
rm (remove)
mkdir (make directory)
rmdir (remove directory)
man (user manual)	
```

###Demo

Let's find our current directory!
	
`$ pwd`

*Returns the directory your are currently in*

Navigate to our home directory

`$ cd`
	
*When cd is used with no parameter, it navigates back to home directory*

You can also get back to the home directory using the ~

`$ cd ~`

Navigate to the directory above

`$ cd ..`

*The periods are important, one period = current directory. two periods = the directory above*

Navigate the two directories above

`$ cd ../..`


List all of the files in our directory

`$ ls`

*Return a list of all the files and folders in the current directory*

Let's list everything in the long format by using the -l flag

`$ ls -l`

###File paths

When you combine directories using `/` "forward slash", you create a **path** through your computer's **file system** 

You can use `cd` to change directories using paths. 

Paths are very useful when giving instructions about how to find certain resources, or assets, that a program or website needs in order to display correctly. 

Paths can be `relative` or `absolute`

###CodeAlong

Making a website using only Terminal:

`$ mkdir hello_world` 

`$ cd hello_world`

`$ touch index.html`

`$ echo "Hello world" > index.html`

`$ open index.html /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/`

`$ open /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/`

Let's remove it

`$ man rm // Find out about the rm command`

`$ cd ..`

`$ rm -rv hello_world`


##Intro to Markdown

Markdown is a mark up language (similar to HTML) commonly used to create READMEs for instructions and information about a code repository or project. It is also a fantastic way for you to take notes as it has all sorts of code-friendly features such as code blocks: 

```javascript 
function javascript_example (message) {
	console.log(message);
}
```
& other useful Markdown tools:

```
#Heading 1
##Heanding 2
###Heading 3...

[links](www.example.com)


* bullet point 
* lists

1. numbered lists
2. with lots of sequential
3. numbers

```

Activity (5 minutes)

1. Open your markdown editor of choice (MacDown)
2. Write some markdown and learn a little bit about this language


##Intro to Github

As a group - let us walk through [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) in order to create our first remote repository, hosted on github. 

##Intro to Github Desktop (GUI)
This is exactly the same, except creating and managing a repo **locally** (on your computer) instead of **remotely** (on github). Later we will discuss how to connect **local** and **remote** so that we can keep **backups** or **share with the open source community**

Step 1. Create a Repository

1. Open the Github Desktop App
2. Click the `+` in the top LEFT to create a new repository.
3. Name your repository `hello-GUI-world`.

Step 2. Create a Branch

1. File > New Branch or `Shift + Command + N`
2. Name it `readme-edits`

Step 3. Make and commit changes

1. Right click `hello-GUI-world` and select `open in Atom`
2. In Atom, right click `hello-GUI-world` Create a new file named "readme.md" and save it
3. Add a couple lines of markdown and then SAVE.
4. Go back to Github GUI and click "commit to readme-edits" after having entered a nice commit message.
5. Click "Compare" and select master, then "update master from readme-edits" 


##Intro to Git (CLI)

As programmers, we prefer to use the Terminal. It allows us to share instructions in the open source community, without having to take a ton of screenshots and create long elaborate tutorials. CLI stands for command line interface. Git has a CLI and well and several different GUI's

Step 1. Create a Repository

1. `$ mkdir hello-world` create a new folder (a.k.a directory)
2. `$ cd hello-word` move into it
1. `$ git init` initialize git tracking
2. `$ touch readme.md` create a new file called "readme.md"

Step 2. Create a Branch

1. `$ git branch readme-edits` create a new branch called "readme-edits"
2. `$ git checkout readme-edits`

Step 3. Make and commit changes

1. `$ open /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/` open the contents of this directory in your text editor (eg Sublime Text) (use tabs to auto-complete long commands!) 
2. make some changes to the code
3. `$ git add -A` add all changes to git
4. `$ git commit -m "nice commit message"` commit changes using a nice message 

##Lab 

Practice creating a new repo, both locally and on github. 

Bonus points if you figure out how to connect remote and local repositories! More on that later!
